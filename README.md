## ⚙️ How to Run the Website Locally

1. **Download and Install XAMPP**

2. **Start Services in XAMPP**  
   - Open **XAMPP Control Panel**
   - Click **Start** next to **Apache**
   - Click **Start** next to **MySQL** (even if not used for now)

3. **Create Your Website Files**
   - Use **Notepad** (or any code editor) to create `index.html`
   - Save the file in this path:  
     ```
     C:\xampp\htdocs\admin\index.html
     ```
   - Create the second page `secpage.html` the same way and save it in the same folder.

4. **Link Between Pages**
   - Inside `index.html`, use a link or button to navigate to `secpage.html`:
     ```html
     <a href="secpage.html">Go to Second Page</a>
     ```
